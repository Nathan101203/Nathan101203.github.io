## Platform for parallel simulator
- Originally developed by the CEA (since 2000);
- Co-developed in partnership since 2007;

## HPC plateform
- Optimized data structure; 
- Facilitated parallelism;

## Object-oriented C++ platform
- Modularity: notion of Arcane ""module"" ; 
- Scalability: notion of Arcane ""service"";
- abstraction: language close to the numericist;
- robustness;

## Arcane structures the application
- Scheduling of the application

## Arcane provides "low-level" services
- Meshing (partitioning, load balancing);
- Input/Output Shutdown/Resume;
- Parallelism;
- Memory management (containers +/- on the mesh);

## ArcGeoSim provides digital services
- Geometric calculations;
- Linear and non-linear solvers (PETSc, Hypre,...);
- VF discretization schemes;
